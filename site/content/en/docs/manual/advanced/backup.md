## Overview

In CVAT you can backup tasks and projects.
This can be used to backup a task or project on your PC or to transfer to another server.

## Create backup

To backup a task or project, open the action menu and select `Backup Task` or `Backup Project`.

As a result, you'll get a task containing data, parameters, and annotations of the previously exported task.
